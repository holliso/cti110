#Write a program that asks the user to enter a
#distance in feet,and prints that same distance
#in inches.

#This is the conversion formula, of course: Inches = Feet * 12

#Create two functions for this program:

def main():
    def feet_to_inches(userfeet):
        inches =( userfeet / 1)* 12
        return inches
    def maim():
        float(input( "please enter the number of feet"))
        
main()
